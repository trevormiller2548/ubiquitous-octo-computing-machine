# ubiquitous-octo-computing-machine
I gave my project this name because I was having trouble thinking of a name that wasn't already taken and Hubspot recommended it. 

For this project I relied on several sources, including some found online. 

For setting conditions, I went to:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat 

To generate characters randomly, I turned to:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43267033/understanding-the-use-of-math-floor-when-randomly-accessing-an-array

I pulled the equation from 03-JavaScript, 01-Activities, 13-Ins_Iteration within the script.js
